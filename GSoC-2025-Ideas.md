# Contributor Guidance

When reaching out to us, please understand that we might not respond to overly generic messages that could be sent to any of the GSoC organizations. We appreciate specific and informed requests, thoughts, or ideas.

To maximize your chance of submitting a successful proposal, we recommend the following:
* Read the [GSoC student guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/).
* Go through the SQLancer resources, in particular, the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/sqlancer/sqlancer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document as well as the [SQLancer YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm7ofmclym1E2LwBeSer_AAhzBSxBYDci).
* Join the [SQLancer Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/sqlancer/shared_invite/zt-eozrcao4-ieG29w1LNaBDMF7OB_~ACg), which is the main means of communication used by the SQLancer developers, and introduce yourself. We also encourage you to share your ideas with us using this platform, so we can support you with your proposal.
* It would significantly strengthen your case if you could show your aptitude by finding an opportunity to create one or multiple PRs. Refactorings would be a low-hanging fruit. For example, you could factor out common functionality in statement generators [like in a previous PR for `UPDATE` SQL statements](https://github.com/sqlancer/sqlancer/pull/662). As another example, you could [update an outdated database system version](https://github.com/sqlancer/sqlancer/blob/main/README.md#faq).
